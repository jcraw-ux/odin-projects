<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Also known as Dutch apple pie, the best crumb pie starts with the apples:
    we always suggest a mix of different tastes and textures for a balanced
    filling that is both sweet and tart with toothsome and soft pieces.
    For example, Granny Smith apples are tart, Golden Delicious hold their
    shape nicely and McIntosh add an applesauce-like quality – a mix of these
    and/or your favorite varieties are ideal. For a simple upgrade, toss
    the filling with a couple tablespoons of heavy or sour cream for added richness.
    The pie dough gets special attention too: a preheated baking sheet acts as
    an extra heat conductor and sets the bottom crust before it has a
    chance to become soggy. Keep an eye on the crumb topping and
    cover with foil if it browns too quickly.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<h3>For the Crust:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup ice water, plus more if needed</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Crumb Topping:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/3 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 stick unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces, at room temperature</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Filling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 pounds mixed apples (such as Golden Delicious, Granny Smith and Gala),
        peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the crust: Whisk the flour, granulated sugar and
        salt in a large bowl. Rub the butter pieces into the flour
        using your fingers until pea-size pieces form. Drizzle
        in the vinegar and ice water; stir gently with a fork
        to combine. If the dough doesn’t hold together when you
        squeeze it, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
        Turn out the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and form
        into a disk; wrap tightly. Refrigerate until firm,
        at least 1 hour or overnight.</li><br>
    <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a
        13-inch round. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges,
        leaving a 1-inch overhang, then tuck the overhanging dough
        under itself; crimp the edges with a fork. Refrigerate
        until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.</li><br>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the crumb topping: Mix the flour,
        brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Rub the
        butter into the mixture with your fingers until no longer
        floury and crumbs form. Freeze until ready to use.</li><br>
    <li>Make the filling: Place a foil-lined baking sheet on the
        lowest oven rack; preheat to 400˚. Mix the apples, melted
        butter, both sugars, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon and salt
        in a large bowl. Spoon the filling into the chilled pie
        crust. Pat the crumb mixture on top.</li><br>
    <li>Bake the pie on the hot baking sheet until lightly
        browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature
        to 350˚ and bake until the apples are completely soft when
        pierced with a paring knife, 60 to 80 more minutes.
        (If the topping is getting too dark, cover loosely with
        foil.) Transfer the pie to a rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
