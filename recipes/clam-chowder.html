<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If salt pork, potatoes, and onions define traditional
    New England clam chowder, then this one is a classic,
    save for the use of bacon instead of salt pork. There’s
    always a pot simmering at this shingled shack on Chatham
    Pier, ready to ladle into pints and quarts. While purists
    might protest the roux (a mixture of butter and flour)
    used as a thickener, this not-too-thick, not-too-thin
    creamy-briny chowder — full of fresh chopped clams,
    potatoes, bacon, and a hint of thyme — will win them over.
    Chowder master Doug Ricciardi’s secret? Keep it “old school”
    by using white pepper. Nothing fancy but mighty fine,
    especially eaten at the nearby picnic tables on a sunny
    day with a view of the water and seals swimming by.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 celery sticks (reserve tender leaves) trimmed
        , quartered lengthwise, then sliced into 1/4-inch
        pieces
    </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
    <li>2 (10-ounce) cans chopped clams in juice</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 pound Idaho potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch
        cubes
    </li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pan Toasted Croutons:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/2 baguette, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the butter in a large pot over medium-high
        heat. Add the onion and celery and saute until
        softened, mixing often. Stir in the flour to
        distribute evenly. Add the stock, juice from 2
        cans of chopped clams (reserve clams), cream, bay
        leaves, and potatoes and stir to combine. Bring
        to a simmer, stirring consistently (the mixture
        will thicken), then reduce the heat to medium-low
        and cook 20 minutes, stirring often, until the
        potatoes are nice and tender. Then add clams
        and season to taste with salt and pepper, cook
        until clams are just firm, another 2 minutes.</li>
        <h3>For the Pan Toasted Croutons:</h3>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet and toss
        the bread cubes in the butter until browned and
        toasted, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add parsley and
        season with salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>
